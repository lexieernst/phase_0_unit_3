Reflection:

I really enjoyed these SQLzoo quizzes. At first I had a hard time creating a username, but found that if I used chrome instead of Safari that it worked! I really like SQL! I find the syntax easier to use than other languages we have studied thus far. Certain functions were not explained in the syntax, so I did have to do some external research. Overall, I enjoyed this experience and am looking forward to working with SQL in the future.
