## Release 4: Design your own Schema

Here is release 4:

With my one-to-one schema, I am demonstrating how having a credit
card to pay for on campus activities such as meals, color printing, or school apparel is optional for college students. If there is a NULL value for visa_payment_id in the student table, then that student has not opted to integrate their credit card into their on campus activities. 

With my many-to-many schema, the designer table is the join table and tells us which brand an article of clothing is. Data about the designer brand and clothing are stored in their respective tables, and they are both used to determine which designer actually created an article of clothing.
