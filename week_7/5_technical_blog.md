- Look up issues with SQL (specifically SQL Injection) Enjoy this [XKCD comic](http://xkcd.com/327/) for an amusing intro. What is it? Why is it a problem? What can newb programmers do to combat this issue?

SQL injection is is a mechanism used by hackers to steal data and information from others. It preys on weak or improper coding of web applications and allows hackers to inject SQL commands to gain access to the data in any given database. This form of hacking may expose secure or secret information or allow a hacker to manipulate a database. To prevent this, coders can use certain characters to constrain input, use parameterized SQL, use an account that has restricted permissions, firewall, and get rid of any database functionality that isn't necessary.
