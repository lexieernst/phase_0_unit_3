# U3.W7: Cultural Blog - Affirmation and Stereotype Threat

I feel very empowered when it comes to my values. I do not expect the stereotype threat to be an issue during my time at DBC. If it is an issue, however, I do feel that my values will allow me to help me understand the issue and attempt to fix it. When I'm feeling down at DBC, I think that taking breaks with others will be very useful. Doing something to get our minds off stress, such as going out for ice cream, working out, or playing cards will be useful in keeping us focused and happy!
