## Evaluate a Website! 
 
1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.

The order of things is handled nicely, and it is visually pleasing, especially in the head. The HTML and CSS are compressed and images are not scaled. It does, however, use inline styles, which is a big no no. Images don't have alt tags and the code is pretty difficult to read. 

Example of bad code: <img src="./Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="10" width="0">
 
2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? 

This programmer seemed to use an excessive amount of IDs and classes... I feel that some were definitely unnecessary

Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.

The tags look complete to me. For some reason, my computer wont let me copy and paste a full tag, but they are all closed. 
 
3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.

They reference two seaparate CSS files called news.css and style.css
 
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what?
 
Yes, I was not sure what the difference between hover and pre hover was or how it affected the functionality

5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?

The way that the authors organized the CSS file was definitely dry, but I don't feel that it was an inefficient way to do it. 
 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?

From what I can see, the authors did not take the time to incorporate any respinsive design into the site. 
 
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read?

Given that this site has a large amount of data, I think the writers of this code do a pretty good job organizing it all. After analyzing this code, I realize how essential IDs are to documents like this. Looking at this has shownn me self-made, extremely complex HTML/CSS files that really show how structured and detailed they must be to succeed.
